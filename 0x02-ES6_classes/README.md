# ES6 Classes and Inheritance

## Project Overview

The "ES6 Classes and Inheritance" project is designed to teach you about essential concepts of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) related to classes and inheritance in JavaScript. By working through this project, you will learn how to:

- Define classes in ES6.
- Add methods to ES6 classes.
- Utilize static methods within classes.
- Extend one class from another.
- Work with getters and setters in classes.

## Getting Started

To begin this project and work on the tasks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend-javascript.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-javascript/0x02-ES6_classes
   ```

3. Ensure you have Node.js (version 12.11.x) installed on your system. You can use the provided script to install Node.js:

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
   ```

4. Verify the installation of Node.js and npm by checking their versions:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

5. Install the required project dependencies, which include Jest, Babel, and ESLint, by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Tasks

The project includes multiple tasks, each contained within its own JavaScript file. To run these tasks individually, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev [task-main-file.js]
```

For instance, to run the first task:

```bash
npm run dev 0-main.js
```

Repeat the command with the appropriate task main file for each task you wish to execute.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `0-classroom.js` to `100-evcar.js`: Each task's JavaScript file corresponds to a specific ES6 concept or feature.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for project dependencies and scripts.
- `babel.config.js`: Babel configuration for transpiling ES6 code.
- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for code linting.

Feel free to explore the tasks, complete them, and enhance your understanding of ES6 classes and inheritance in JavaScript. Enjoy the learning journey!
