# ALX JavaScript Project - ES6 Basics Project

This project is part of the ALX Backend JavaScript Curriculum and covers fundamental concepts of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in JavaScript. It includes a series of tasks to practice and understand ES6 features. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the project and instructions for running the tasks.

## Project Overview

The ES6 Basics project focuses on the following key ES6 concepts:

1. **Const and Let:** Understanding when to use `const` and `let` for variable declarations.

2. **Block Scope:** Managing variables in block scope to prevent unintentional overwriting.

3. **Arrow Functions:** Converting standard functions to ES6 arrow functions for concise syntax.

4. **Parameter Defaults:** Using default parameter values to simplify function logic.

5. **Rest Parameter Syntax:** Counting the number of arguments passed to a function using the rest parameter.

6. **Spread Syntax:** Concatenating arrays and strings using spread syntax.

7. **Template Literals:** Using template literals for string interpolation.

8. **Object Property Shorthand:** Simplifying object property assignments.

9. **Computed Property Names:** Dynamically creating object properties using computed property names.

10. **ES6 Method Properties:** Defining methods in object literals using ES6 method properties.

11. **For...of Loops:** Iterating over arrays using the ES6 `for...of` loop.

12. **Iterators:** Creating an object to store department names and employees.

## Getting Started

To run the tasks in this project, you'll need Node.js and npm installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd 0x00-ES6_basic
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Tasks

Each task is located in a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `0-constants.js`, `1-block-scoped.js`, etc.). To run a specific task, you can use the `npm run dev` command followed by the task's main file. For example:

```
npm run dev 0-main.js
```

Replace `0-main.js` with the appropriate task's main file for each task.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files and folders:

- `0-constants.js` to `12-createReportObject.js`: Individual task files for each ES6 concept.

- `package.json`: Configuration file for project dependencies and scripts.

- `babel.config.js`: Babel configuration for transpiling ES6 code.

- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for code linting.
